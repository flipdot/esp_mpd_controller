# MPD-Controller
The MPD-Controller is an MPD-Hardware-Interface driven by an ESP8266-Controller:

## Usage
The code can be built and uploaded using [platformio](http://platformio.org/).

## Limitations
The code runs with polling. Interrupts would be better. Only uses the options next and last song.
